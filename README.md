# Thank you for using YoshiGamerFR's image analyzer!<br><br>
## This image analyzer lets you analyze your video game screenshots and create a copy of it in black and white.<br><br>
## Why use this image analyzer?
This image analyzer software <a href="#whythisone">analyzes</a> the image you give it, replaces the green background (your screenshot has to be with a green background) and replaces it either black or white, depending on the result you want, and recolors everything else with the opposite color.<br>
<span id="whythisone">Why this program? I made it for curious gamers who want to see how much screenspace their viewmodel or different weapons/tools take in FPS games.</span><br>
I took this idea from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3p5PxYeiClU">Onemansquadron</a> who has done a similar program (in C *I believe*) for CS2 knives.
<br><br>
## How does it work?
### This program has 3 main steps:
- The program first asks you to input whether you will enter a "**file**" or a "**folder**". If your input is "**file**", the program then asks you for the exact image, then asks you the color you want the background to be ("**black**" or "**white**").If your input is "**folder**", the program will go through the folder "*images*" and analyze every image in it one by one.<br>
- Depending on what mode you inputed, it will either open the "*images*" folder and analyze every image, or simply open and analyze the inputed image. After the analysis, it replaces the green background of your image with your choice of color, and all other elements with the opposite color.<br>
- The program then saves the image/s inside the "*output*" folder.
<br><br>
## Disclaimer:
Please note that this program might be slow depending on your computer's hardware, as it is made in Python. I will try to improve this program with more quality of life functions, like asking the user what color the backdrop of the image is. <br>
__You may contact me and suggest ideas for this project, and I will do my best to recreate them!__<br><br><br>
## If you downloaded the source code:
- If you are using the version v1.0.0 of the program:
  - Please create a folder named "output".
  - If you want to use the "*folder*" mode, please create a directory named "**images**" and place the images you want to be analyzed in it.
- If you are using a newer version of the progam (v1.0.1 and above):
  - If you want to use the "*folder*" mode, please create a directory named "**images**" and place the images you want to be analyzed in it.
